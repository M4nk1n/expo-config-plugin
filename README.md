# Expo Config Plugins

- A collection of [Expo config plugins](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/config-plugins/) for configuring the `expo prebuild` command.
- This repo is to Expo config plugins as [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) is to TypeScript.
- We prefer packages ship their own Expo config plugin (to ensure versioning is aligned), but if they haven't adopted the system yet, the community can add a package here.
- All packages here are community maintained. Feel free to improve docs, packages, tests, etc.
- We maintain a 1-1 mapping of **native packages** â‡” `@config-plugins/*`. This means there should be no general utility packages here -- those are better suited for a different repo / NPM namespace.

## Awesome

Here is a list of known packages that have a built-in Config Plugin.

### No Plugin Required

Just install and rebuild! If a package doesn't require any futher setup then it most likely doesn't need an Expo config plugin. Most packages work without a config plugin (including packages not listed below):

- [react-native-share](https://github.com/react-native-share/react-native-share)
- [@react-native-menu/menu](https://github.com/react-native-menu/menu)
- [react-native-blurhash](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-blurhash)
- [react-native-app-shortcuts](https://github.com/lokyoung/react-native-app-shortcuts)
- [react-native-multiple-image-picker](https://github.com/baronha/react-native-multiple-image-picker)
- [`@shopify/flash-list`](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list)
